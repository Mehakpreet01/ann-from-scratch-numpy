# Artificial Neural Network from Scratch (NumPy)

This project implements a simple Artificial Neural Network using NumPy.

## Features
- Forward propagation
- Backpropagation
- Mean Squared Error loss
- Training loop
- Visualization using Matplotlib

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Outcome
The loss decreases over epochs, showing that the model learns successfully.
